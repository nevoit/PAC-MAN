# PAC-MAN

Nevo Itzhak and Tomer Shahar

In this project we wrote a version of the popular Pacman game in HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript/JQuery. The website involved registering and logging in (without the use of a DB â€“ i.e registering is saved per session), selecting options for the game and providing as much of an interactive experience as possible for the user. We also used the Bootstrap 4 library.

The most difficult part developing this game was ensuring the game itself works as expected and is intuitive. Javascript proved to be a tricky language to learn and use properly, and a lot of effort went in ensuring that the game runs smoothly and without bugs or undefined behavior.
