# PAC-MAN

Nevo Itzhak and Tomer Shahar

This game was created using a combination of Javascript, JQuery, HTML and css through the bootstrap library.

The most difficult part developing this game was ensuring the game itself works as expected and is intuitive. Javascript proved to be a tricky language to learn and use properly, and a lot of effort went in ensuring that the game runs smoothly and without bugs or undefined behavior.
